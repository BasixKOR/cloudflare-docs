R2 product and bucket description

// User creates buckets and decides how to access (HTTP/Worker/CLI).

## 1. Install Wrangler

To create your R2 bucket, install [Wrangler](/get-started/guide#2-install-the-workers-cli), the Workers CLI.

To install [`wrangler`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler), ensure you have [`npm` installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), preferably using a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues or to easily change Node.js versions, then run:

```sh
$ npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
```
or install with yarn:

```sh
$ yarn global add @cloudflare/wrangler
```
or install with cargo:

```sh
$ cargo install wrangler
```
Refer to the Wrangler [Install/Update](/cli-wrangler/install-update) page for more information.

## 2. Authenticate Wrangler

With installation complete, `wrangler` will need access to a Cloudflare OAuth token to manage Workers resources on your behalf.

Run the command `wrangler login`, which will automate this process.

Wrangler will attempt to automatically open your web browser to complete the login process to your Cloudflare account. If you have issues completing this step or you do not have access to a browser GUI, you can copy and paste the URL generated by `wrangler login` in your terminal into a browser and log in.

```sh
$ wrangler login
Allow Wrangler to open a page in your browser? [y/n]
y
üíÅ  Opened a link in your default browser: https://dash.cloudflare.com/oauth2/...
```

Open the browser, log into your account, and select **Allow**. This will send an OAuth Token to Wrangler so it can deploy your scripts to Cloudflare.

## 3. Create your bucket

Create your bucket by running `wrangler r2 bucket create <your-bucket-name>`:

```sh
wrangler r2 bucket create <your-bucket-name>
```

To check that your bucket was created, run:

```sh
wrangler r2 bucket list
```
